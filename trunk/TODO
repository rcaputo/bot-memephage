It's not very good code. :)

Database Back Ends
------------------

Currently memephage creates a flat links.list file in the current
directory.  That file is read entirely into memory at startup, and
large databases can take several dozens of megabytes.

coral: In the near future, this will all be tied through Postgres.

coral: schema.text is in cvs and will be postgres-ized someday.

-------------
Mailing Lists
-------------

coral: Set up per-mailing-list aliases or something. RRE,
       progstone. memephage+rre@ maps to POST rre=<msg> multiple
       messages - outlook attached message support!  MIME!

------------
Future Ideas
------------

coral: Generate thumbnails for linked images, and show them inline in
       place of descriptions.  Inline showing disabled by default,
       enabled perhaps with a ?f=b parameter.

coral: Submit URLs to the Internet archive (web.archive.org)
       http://www.alexa.com/cgi-bin/request_bot.cgi?url=$url&redirect=$url
       There definitely are some downsides to this one.
