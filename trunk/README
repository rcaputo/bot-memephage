It's not very good code. :)

It will create a links.list file in the current directory.  That file
will be read entirely into memory at startup, and it won't be touched
again until the bot shuts down.

[coral]: In the near future, this will all be tied through Postgres.

rcc: Fixed the path for links.list.  Duh.
coral: schema.text is in cvs and will be postgres-ized someday.
coral: html encoding of html output is useful. done.

** Feature ideas:

[coral]: generate thumbnails and show them
         (disabled by default, enabled by cgi ?f=b parameter)
