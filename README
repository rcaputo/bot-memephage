About
-----

Memephage is a bot (IRC and/or MUD) that identifies URLs in casual
conversation and logs them.  Its URL log is visible from its
integrated web server.

Memephage can also extract URLs from e-mail, and its title web page
includes a JavaScript bookmarklet that can be used to submit links
directly from a browser's "personal toolbar".

Links gathered by memephage are verified by its integrated web client.
In the pracess, the bot gathers a page or resource's MIME type, size,
title, description, and keywords.  This information is rather
unceremoniously displayed in the log:

  Title:       SatireWire | PENTAGON INSISTS REAL RATS NOT BEING USED
  Description: Under withering fire from animal rights activists, who
               blasted the Pentagon's plans to fit live rats with
               electrodes so they could be steered toward hidden bombs
               or disaster victims, the U.S. Defense Department today
               promised that actual rats will not be used.

As if that weren't enough, it re-verifies its links weekly, updating
their Status as they change.

------------
Requirements
------------

Perl 5.005, but Perl 5.6.1 or newer is recommended.

You'll need the following Perl modules.

  Filter::Util::Call
  HTML::Entities
  Time::HiRes
  POE
  POE::Component::IRC
  POE::Component::JobQueue
  POE::Component::Client::DNS
  POE::Component::Client::HTTP
  URI::Heuristic

If you're using the experimental Postgres database back-end, you'll
need Postgres (of course) and:

  (TODO: List the Postgres dependencies here)

You'll also need to build a database:

  % createdb memephage
  % psql -q memephage < docs/schema.sql

----------
Setting up
----------

If this is your first time setting up, copy memephage.conf-dist to
memephage.conf and customize it.  Otherwise check memephage.conf-dist
for new options, and merge them into your existing configuration.

Run memephage.perl.

------
Errors
------

* IRC client (foo): socket error occurred: Can't assign requested address

  The most likely cause of this is an unknown host name, either for a
  local machine or a remote IRC server.  If you have multiple servers
  specified, the bot will try the next server in approximately one
  minute.
